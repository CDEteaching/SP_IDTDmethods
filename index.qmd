*Version 1.0, July 2025*

In this online course, you will explore the foundations of inter- and transdisciplinary (ID/TD) methods, essential for addressing complex societal challenges. The course introduces the distinction between scientific and non-scientific knowledge and the criteria used to evaluate scientific methods. You will also delve into the principles of good and responsible research, including the ethical standards and integrity required for conducting high-quality research. Across eight units, you will gain practical skills in searching, managing, and analyzing scientific literature and synthesizing it into coherent written texts. The units cover topics such as scientific and non-scientific knowledge, three types of knowledge, transparent referencing, research ethics, and ID/TD methods. By completing this course, you will develop a solid understanding of the core principles of scientific inquiry, along with the practical tools necessary for conducting ethical and responsible research.

The completion of this course is recognized with 1.5 ECTS credits and therefore requires a workload equivalent to approximately 45 hours of study (online course and preparation of assessment).
