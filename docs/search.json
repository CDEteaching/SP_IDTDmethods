    "text": "1.1 Sustainable development - Sustainability\nIt is becoming increasingly evident that disciplinary approaches and disciplinary specializations are often insufficient to understand and address the complex challenges and wicked problems of the 21st century. Sustainable development issues, in particular, extend across various scientific and thematic fields. This necessitates collaboration between disparate disciplines and other stakeholders. Thus, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are considered to be essential research approaches in the field of sustainability science.\nSustainability science can be understood as an arena where “contributions from the whole spectrum of the natural sciences, economics, and social sciences” (Martens 2006, 38) meet. Sustainability science distinguishes itself from “traditional” sciences, so-called mode-1 sciences (see Table 1.1), since it follows the normative ideas of sustainability.",

The following quote from Robert W. Kates captures appropriately the significance of sustainability science: “A new field of sustainability science is emerging that seeks to understand the fundamental character of interactions between nature and society. Such an understanding must encompass the interaction of global processes with the ecological and social characteristics of particular places and sectors” (Kates et al. 2001, 1).",

    "text": "1.2 Normativity\nAs sustainable development is a normative model, it is important to distinguish between descriptive (empirical-analytical) research and prescriptive (normative) research. Descriptive statements describe the current state (“is”, e.g., vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins), while normative statements describe the ideal state (“ought”, e.g., you should eat vegetables). In everyday life, the distinction between “is” and “ought” is often not recognized, but it is crucial for science. Moreover, it is essential to recognize that individuals hold diverse perspectives, which can lead to diverging opinions regarding what is optimal or what sustainability should entail. Consequently, the concepts of “sustainability” or “sustainable development” cannot be regarded as impartial or neutral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Distinction between empirical-analytical and normative (Own illustration).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet active - Dilemmas\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on an issue in your personal/social environment, where different persons have different ideas about how a problem should be solved or what sustainability should look like.",

    "section": "1.3 Ethics",
    "text": "1.3 Ethics\nBecause sustainability/sustainable development is per se normative, this can lead to dilemmas (which means problems do not have an optimal solution). When looking at wicked problems such as biodiversity loss in agricultural areas there are multiple possible approaches: (1) protecting and promoting rare and extinction-threatened species and therefore reducing food production or (2) focusing on species with great abundance, which might be more important to economics and food security but would neglect rare species.\nDepending on context, background and/or beliefs, some would prefer one approach over the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Sustainable Development as a normative concept (Own illustration).\n\n\n\nEthics offers orientation and decision-making structures in order to find a suitable course of action in situations such as complex dilemmas. Ethics deals with the reflection and evaluation of moral actions and behaviour and is therefore the philosophical study of morals (moral norms, value judgments and institutions). There are numerous ethical approaches, two central ones of normative ethics being “teleological” and “deontological” approaches. Teleological ethics evaluates actions based on their goals or purposes, which are considered “good”. An example of this is utilitarianism (established by Jeremy Bentham), which judges actions according to how much utility or happiness they produce. Deontological ethics, on the other hand, focuses on duties and evaluates actions based on their characteristics rather than their consequences. An example of this is Kant’s duty-based ethics (Kantianism), which judges actions according to whether they comply with a moral rule or duty.\nThe concept of sustainability usually has a positive connotation, but it can be viewed from different perspectives. In order to function as a guiding principle (in an ecological, social, and economic sense), it requires clear criteria. But what grounds can we use to define these criteria?\nAccording to Hirsch Hadorn and Brun (2007), “sustainable development” should:\n\nfulfil needs…\n… in a just way\n… with a view to people living today and in the future, and\ntaking into account the diversity of values and the limit to which nature can be used.\n\nThe guiding principle of sustainable development is therefore not only the result of scientific research, but is first and foremost a normative, ethically based concept. It brings together “ethical and analytical ideas” and formulates “norms that express what is desirable and what should happen” (Renn et al. 2007, 39). As a result, sustainable development is a social process of negotiation and decision-making – of searching, learning, and gaining experience – that is guided by ethical considerations. Accordingly, sustainability research must always be aware of its involvement in social processes of perception and evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHans Jonas’ Ethics of Responsibility (1979)\n\n\n\n\n\nHans Jonas’ ethics of responsibility (1979) offers an important contribution to the sustainability debate by emphasizing the ethical responsibility for future generations and nature. Jonas’ approach can be described as a kind of “future ethics” that aims to address the specific new challenges of action in the context of “technological civilization”. The link to sustainability ethics lies in his understanding of the concept of responsibility: Jonas understands ethical responsibility as a “non-reciprocal relationship” (Jonas 1987, 177), the asymmetry of which is derived from the power of a moral subject over one or something else that requires care: “Responsibility is the concern for another being, recognized as a duty, which becomes ‘concern’ when its vulnerability is threatened” (Jonas 1987, 391). Jonas’ approach differs from other ethical theories in that it does not take the existence of humanity for granted and includes duties to future generations as well as to nature. Jonas argues that the first duty of future ethics is to grasp the distant effects of human action (Jonas 1987, 64). In view of the uncertainty about the future effects of human action, he advocates the decision rule “in dubio pro malo” (in doubt for the bad): “[…] when in doubt, give ear to the worse prognosis before the better, for the stakes have become too great for the game” (Jonas 1987, 67). Jonas thus develops a new categorical imperative that demands the preservation of nature and humanity and is based on the assumption of an intrinsic purposefulness of nature: “Act in such a way that the effects of your action are contractual with the permanence of genuine human life on earth”, or “Act in such a way that the effects of your action are not destructive of the future possibilities of such life” (Jonas 1987, 36).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGibbons, Michael, Camille Limoges, Helga Nowotny, and Simon Schwartzman. 2010.

    "text": "2.3 Quality criteria of trandisciplinary research\nSustainability sciences often follow transdisciplinary research designs. Belcher et al. (2016) describe transdisciplinary research as crossing disciplinary and institutional boundaries, and as being context specific, and problem oriented. Moreover, it combines and blends methodologies from different theoretical paradigms, includes a diversity of both academic and societal actors, and is conducted with a range of research goals, organizational forms, and outputs. It is widely acknowledged that complex and wicked social problems, as those who are the research topics of sustainability sciences, as well as the claim to contribute to reals world solutions, are best approaches by such comprehensive and holistic approaches such as provided by transdisciplinary research designs. However, as boundaries between disciplines are crossed, and as research engages more with stakeholders in complex systems, traditional academic definitions and criteria of research quality are no longer sufficient—there is a need for a parallel evolution of principles and criteria to define and evaluate research quality in a transdisciplinary research context. This is, why Belcher et al. (2016) propose, based on a comprehensive literature review, the following four quality criteria for transdisciplinary research (cf. Table 3 in Belcher et al. 2016):\n\nRelevance: The importance, significance, and usefulness of the research problem, objectives, processes, and findings to the problem context\nCredibility: The research findings are robust and the sources of knowledge are dependable. This includes clear demonstration of the adequacy of the data and the methods used to procure the data including clearly presented and logical interpretation of findings\nLegitimacy: The research process is perceived as fair and ethical. This encompasses the ethical and fair representation of all involved and the appropriate and genuine inclusion and consideration of diverse participants, values, interests, and perspectives\nEffectiveness: The research generates knowledge and stimulates actions that address the problem and contribute to solutions and innovation\n\nThe quality of transdisciplinary knowledge production therefore does not follow any rigid quality criteria of disciplinary research paradigms. Rather, various methodological approaches are combined, depending on the best fit with the desired research objectives and questions, with regard to the inclusion of all participants, and with regard to implementation and solution-orientation. The selected research approaches are implemented in such a way as to maximise credibility. Following Belcher et al. (2016), credible high-quality research is authoritative, transparent, defensible, believable, and rigorous. For this, traditional disciplinary criteria can be applied to transdisciplinary research. However, additional and modified criteria are needed to address the integration of epistemologies and methodologies and the development of novel methods through collaboration, the broad preparation and competencies required to carry out the research, and the need for reflection and adaptation when operating in complex systems.\nFor scientists who engage in or evaluate transdisciplinary research, this means that they should be open to and tolerant of different scientific methods and corresponding comprehensive set of quality criteria.\nMoreover, Walter and Kremer (2023, 340) argue that within transdisciplinary learning contexts, the different cultures of knowledge provide the potential for a more holistic reflection, and therefore more comprehensive understanding. Persons who intend to collaborate in a transdisciplinary research project or educational task should reflect on and communicate their sources of knowledge, its reliability, and limitations. Conscious discussion may enhance mutual understanding for different approaches, documentation, and methodologies in scientific knowledge acquisition and therefore may prevent possible misconceptions. In addition, this reflection may help to identify common points of contact and complementary additions to the various disciplinary levels of knowledge, thereby enhancing mutual learning.",

Rather, the transparent disclosure of sources and decisions made, the quality of the underlying data and the comprehensibility of interpretations are central to gaining confidence in the quality of the knowledge gained. In view of the possibilities created by intelligent systems (e.g., AI) in the production of knowledge, many researchers are also tempted to resort to questionable methods in the production of knowledge (see examples in Lüscher 2019). So, how can you recognise whether a scientific publication (especially if it does not originate from your own discipline) is of high quality?\nWe suggest the following questions that can be asked of a publication in order to assess its quality:\nWhat is the quality of the content?\n\nThe aformentioned quality criteria can be applied here\n\nWho is/are the author(s)?\n\nIs/are the author(s) writing about a topic on which they are also conducting research (or are they commenting on topics that do not correspond to their primary research)?\nDoes the author(s) have a reputation in this field?\nMight there be any conflicts of interest?\n\nWho is the publisher?\n\nDoes the publisher specialise in scientific publications in the relevant subject area?\nWhat is the reputation of the publisher (see list of predatory publishers)?\nMight there be any conflicts of interest?\n\nWho is the target audience?\n\nWas the publication written for a scientific audience (or is it, for example, a textbook for students or a specialist article for a non-scientific audience)?\n\nHow was the publication received in the scientific community?\n\nHas the publication been cited by others (cf. citation indices)?\nAre there any reviews?\n\nPlease note that there is no simple yes-no answer regarding the quality of publications.

    "text": "3.1 Three types of Knowledge\nSystems knowledge is defined as the comprehension of the existing state of a system, encompassing the investigation of pertinent structures and processes, as well as their intricacy and dynamics within the framework of sustainable development. This is accomplished through a variety of methods, including qualitative and quantitative approaches, mixed methods, experiments, and system dynamics approaches, which frequently incorporate forecasts, retrospectives, and scenario analyses. The majority of studies on the generation of systems knowledge are classified as empirical research (Figure 3.1).\nTarget knowledge refers to what should be achieved and what should be avoided, and is particularly relevant through normative research. This encompasses the interpretation and concretization of the values associated with sustainable development, as well as the derivation of additional norms. Research that addresses the definition of thresholds, assessment methods, and visioning processes facilitates the formulation of clear recommendations regarding the necessary transformations (Figure 3.1).\nTransformation knowledge is the process of moving from the current state to the desired state, achieved through the integration of both system and target knowledge. This entails the pursuit of demonstrably effective solutions to identified problems within the context of sustainable development. There are a number of methods that can be employed to achieve this. (translated from Ilias and enhanced with deepl) Research on transformations, i.e. the change in social organisation at different levels, can be both empirical and normative. Research focussing on past and present transformations is empirical. In contrast, research focussing on how concrete goals can be achieved is normative. This distinction is also acknowledged by the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU), which employs the terms “transformation” or “transformative research.” In the context of transformations, transformative education is emphasised, which aims to promote the acquisition of skills for a comprehensive and multi-layered understanding of change (Schneidewind 2013). The objective is to enhance the capacity for reflection within society, encompassing both the terms and ability of observing and actively shaping transformation processes (Figure 3.1).",

Referring to sources not only acknowledges the knowledge of others, it also makes your own contribution more comprehensible and more substantial.\nIn their introductory work, Zabed and Qi (2022, 493) give numerous examples of when a reference is required:\n\nWhen describing or discussing a definition, theory, model, concept, or practice associated with a particular writer; e.g., “Referencing can be defined as the acknowledgement of the works or ideas of other persons, which have been published formally or are available in the public domain in another way” (Reference).\nTo demonstrate the importance of the work; e.g., “It has been reported that environmental conditions significantly affect the growth of a crop during field experiment” (Reference).\nTo point out a research gap in the report; e.g., “In a recent study, it has been pointed out that still there is no scientific data on how the migrant workers can contribute to the social stability of the country” (Reference).\nTo show the vastness of the research work on the specific topic of the writer; e.g., “Numerous studies have been done over the last several decades to improve technical and technological aspects of energy production” (Reference-1; Reference-2; Reference-3 and so on).\nTo describe the method(s) used in the study; e.g., “Starch content in the rice flour was determined by the enzymatic method” (Reference).\nTo mention the source of data used in the research/report; e.g., “Data present in this report on weather conditions during the experiment were obtained from the Ministry of Science and Technology, Malaysia” (Reference).\nTo identify the source of a material or equipment used during an experiment; e.g., “The constructs used in this study were drawn from recent research” (Reference)\nTo show the similarity of the research outcome(s) to others’ work; e.g., “In our investigation, it was observed that organizational performance decreased significantly with the decrease in workforce diversity. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere” (Reference).\nTo compare the study results with literature; e.g., “The blood pressure (BP) was recorded 140/95 in a patient under a stress condition. In an earlier study, BP was reported 145/90 in a patient under the same stress condition” (Reference).\nTo explain the research outcomes logically; e.g., “It was observed that ethanol concentration reached a plateau after a certain time. This might have happened for the exhaustion of soluble sugars over time” (Reference).\n\nKnowledge that can be assumed as general knowledge for the target audience (e.g., in the introduction) does not have to be referenced. For example: “climate change is a mayor threat to food systems”.\nOwn statements, considerations and conclusions (unless they refer to earlier, published material) do not have to contain references. They can be made explicitly recognizable as such to the reader with an active choice of words (examples: I / we propose … I / we assume, … I / we conclude …).",

Paraphrased passages, direct quotations and other material (e.g. images) taken from third parties (or from our own earlier publications) are identified as such. In the case of protected material, appropriate permission must also be obtained for its use.\nA reference system consists of a style that is consistently applied to the whole product, based on two elements (Zabed and Qi 2022):\n\nCiting the source material in the text\nListing the full details of each source (usually at the end), so that it is easy to find. This list does not contain any entries that do not also appear within the text.\n\nThere exist numerous different reference styles. These are sometimes specified by a particular academic field, or by a particular publication format (e.g. a specific journal). Examples of reference styles that use the “in-text name style” are APA, Chicago or Harvard. Examples of reference styles that use the “in-text numerical style” are Vancouver, ACS or IEEE.\nUnless explicitly stated otherwise by the lecturers, you are free to choose which citation style you would like to use in our degree program, but you are expected to transparently refer to third party work by referencing it and to apply the chosen reference style consistently across the whole publication. For each style, there are extensive rules on how to refer to sources in the text and how to present different types of sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples for reference styles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPA reference style\nVancouver reference style",

This relates to several levels of accountability, including those of individual researchers, their institutions, (potential) clients, the government, and the general public. Only a high level of integrity allows to maintain society’s trust in research, to protect the reputation of researchers and institutions, to ensure the reproducibility of research results, and to prevent fraud and misconduct (Alavi and Schmohl 2023).\nGood scientific practice and scientific integrity adheres to legal regulations (e.g. New Federal Act on Data Protection), as well as principles and codes of conduct on research ethics and scientific integrity of the scientific academies (e.g. The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity of All European Academies, or the Code of conduct for scientific integrity of the Swiss Academies). Various scientific communities and academic fields also specify further codes and principles ( e.g., the Guide for Transboundary Research Partnerships of the Swiss Alliance for Global Research Partnerships, the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct of the American Psychology Association, or the Code of Ethics of the International Sociological Association).\nFor international and interdisciplinary researchers, this means that they must actively inform themselves about the applicable laws in the countries in which they conduct their research, as well as the applicable principles and codes of conduct of their (disciplinary) research communities.\nIn our view, the following principles are particularly important for students on the Master’s programme on Sustainability Transformations.",

    "text": "5.2 Basic principles\nBased on recommendations of All European Academies (ALLEA), the Swiss Academies have formulated four basic principles of scientific integrity (Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences 2021, 15):\n\nReliability in ensuring the quality of research and teaching in order to maximise the credibility of, and trust in, science. Reliability is reflected in particular in the design, methodology, and analysis of research; it involves both transparency and traceability.\nHonesty in developing, designing, undertaking, reviewing, reporting and communicating research and teaching activities. These activities should be carried out in a transparent manner with a view to achieving maximum impartiality.\nRespect for colleagues, students, study and research participants, society, our cultural heritage, ecosystems and the environment. Due consideration should be given to the diversity and life experience of all persons involved.\nAccountability for research – from an idea to its valorisation and transfer – and for its administration and organisation as well as for training, supervision, mentoring, and the careful use of resources.\n\nMoreover, the EU specified in its European Charter for Researchers a set of general principles and requirements which specifies the roles, responsibilities and entitlements of researchers. They are aimed at all researchers at all stages of their careers and cover all areas of research in the public and private sectors. The Charter formulates the following general principles and requirements for researchers:\n\nResearch freedom\nProfessional attitude\nGood practice in research\nRelation with supervisors\nEthical principles\nContractual and legal obligations\nDissemination, exploitation of results\nSupervision and managerial duties\nProfessional responsibility\nAccountability\nPublic engagement\nContinuing professional development",

    "text": "5.3 Good research practices\nFrom these basic principles, more concrete implications for good scientific practices can be derived, for example (for more details cf. Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences 2021):\n\n5.3.1 In the production and dissemination of knowledge\n\nResponsible data management is required when handling the data. This ensures security and longevity of data, as well as reproducibility of research results. On the one hand, the procedures follow the requirements of data protection guidelines and data management plans, on the other hand, they are oriented on Open Science Guidelines.\nWhen producing knowledge, it is important to disclosure apparent, potential, and actual conflicts of interests. It is also required to respect intellectual property, and to explicitly and correctly refer to existing knowledge and literature\nIt also means to use AI in research responsibly and make their use transparent (cf. CDE AI Guidelines) It goes without saying that due diligence is required when collecting and analysing data and no practices that contravene scientific integrity are used (such as e.g. data fabrication, cf. also the regulations concerning scientific integrity of the University of Bern, Article 5).\n\n\n\n5.3.2 In the collaboration with colleagues\n\nGood practice in this regard includes, for example, naming all persons who have made a significant contribution to the planning, realisation and quality as authors.\nPeer review procedures are an important quality assurance mechanism in science. Researchers should also make their contribution here and provide appropriate feedback with a commitment to objectivity, impartiality, and confidentiality.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 When involving human participangs in data collection1\n\nWhen data is collected from human participants (mostly in humanities and social sciences, as well as in transdisciplinary research, e.g. through observations or surveys, but also on social media), it is essential to comply with the applicable data protection laws. Both the European Data Protection Act and the New Federal Act on Data Protection stipulate corresponding requirements.\nThe different (disciplinary) research communities often go one step further in their research ethics guidelines (e.g. the Ethics in Social Science and Humanities for the European Commission). These place the dignity and well-being of the participants at the center, particularly, if vulnerable groups are involved. Most of these research ethical guidelines are based on the Belmont Report of the National Commission for the protection of Human Subjects of biomedical and behavioural Research of the United States. The Belmont Report defines three basic ethical principles:\n\nRespect for Persons expresses the ethical convictions that the autonomy of individuals should be respected and that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to equal protection.\n➔ This results, for example, in the requirements of voluntariness, confidentiality/anonymity, and informed consent.\nBeneficence describes an obligation to protect subjects from harm by maximizing possible benefits and minimizing possible harms. ➔ Participants must not suffer any impairments or disadvantages as a result of their participation (e.g. no negative emotions). If this is the case, such burdens must be justified by the benefits of the research. An ethics committee should decide whether this is the case.\nJustice promotes equitable representation in research in terms of fairly distributing the risks and benefits of research. ➔ The groups of people involved must not suffer any disadvantages as a result of their participation (e.g. refusal of treatment if they are assigned to the control group).",

In order to put this goal into practice, a participatory strategy process was initiated with numerous stakeholders from the region. Representatives from the public sector, local clubs and associations, the tourism and mobility sector, energy producers and suppliers, the private sector and the agricultural and forestry sectors have developed a joint “vision” and “transition paths” (these describe the steps required to realize the vision). In addition, initial “transition experiments” were outlined (i.e. pilot projects that reduce regional GHG emissions, such as support for biogas production by local farmers). All of this was published in a “Transition Agenda”.\nThis process was initiated, accompanied and researched by an inter- and transdisciplinary team of CDE researchers from the disciplines of psychology, geography and communication sciences together with representatives of regional authorities. CDE researchers were responsible for identifying and involving key regional stakeholders, as well as facilitating a series of workshops to develop the transition agenda. In addition, a survey was conducted among the local population to find out whether they supported the vision developed by the regional representatives. The results of the survey were then incorporated into the strategy process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Visions of a climate neutral region Oberland-Ost (illustration by Samuel Bucheli).\n\n\n\nThe project was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE (Energy Research and Cleantech Section) and co-financed by the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern and the Economic, Energy and Environmental Directorate of the Canton of Bern.\nMore Information on the project on the CDE-project website.",

It is therefore of great importance for students to gain an understanding of their socialization and the methods they have employed during their studies. This enables them to engage in critical evaluation and application of different research methods in their respective fields. Moreover, it is essential to understand the relative merits and limitations of each approach and its potential applicability in inter- and transdisciplinary contexts.",

    "text": "7.2 ID/TD methods\nAt present, there is a considerable array of distinct ID/TD methodologies, derived from both research and practice. The objective of this section is not to present a comprehensive account of applied methods; rather, it aims to offer insights into a select number of methods. However, before we start to explore ID/TD methods, it is essential to acknowledge that a vast variety of scientific methods are used. Various scientific methods offer specific approaches to analysing the objects of investigation and are considered complementary, as they provide different approaches to description and explanation. The choice of method therefore depends heavily on the research question and the object of investigation (cf. Schirmer 2009, 129ff). The range of scientific methods is huge, making it difficult to categorise them. Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) used semi-structured interviews with scientists to ask about their understanding of the frequently used categorisation into quantitative and qualitative research. It is important to note here that the categorisation into quantitative and qualitative methods is made particularly in the social sciences - as Pilcher and Cortazzi (2024) show. In some disciplines, researchers only conduct a certain type of research and never need anything other than clear ‘quantitative’ definitions (e.g. mathematical sciences); others only conduct research that involves texts but not numbers (e.g. literary studies). Further, some researchers considered how certain aspects lie outside the ‘qualitative’ or ‘quantitative’ (e.g. the ‘theoretical’ in German studies), or they conducted research that they considered to contain no ‘knowledge’ (sculpture in the visual arts), while others conducted basic ‘conceptual’ research that they considered to be at a stage prior to any quantity or quality judgement (philosophy). Finally, some researchers considered the terms to be of little relevance to their specialisms.\nIn many cases, the problems and issues in sustainability science require integrative, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches in addition to human and natural science methods. By definition, interdisciplinary science, as sustainability science is, positions itself across the disciplines. For them, translations between disciplines are important. And when transdisciplinary approaches enter the respective social field and thus dissolve the disciplinary institutional distance, this must also have methodological consequences: It is about more inductive approaches in which the multiplicity of positions and approaches is recognised (Berger 2010). Collaboration in heterogeneous groups with experts and stakeholders (from science and/or practice) creates a mutual learning and research process, as all those involved can contribute their specific experience, knowledge and disciplinary methods to the project. In this way, existing methods are sometimes recombined and reimplemented.\nInterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary methods are characterised by the fact that they support the integration of different knowledge and enable co-creative processes for the development of sustainability contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring methods\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the wide variety of applied ID/TD methods, we won’t be able to demonstrate everything in our study programme. Therefore, you can also explore some ID/TD methods yourself:\n\nExplore the td-net Toolbox and read through the presented methods. We recommend reading the tools “actor constellation”, “three types of knowledge tool”, and “Theory of Change”. Feel free to read through further methods/tools.\nWe recommend to read the chapters “Citizen Science” and “Indigenous Knowledge” from the “Handbook Transdisciplinary Learning” (Philipp and Schmohl 2023). You can download the full book-pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\n\n\n\nThe textbook Research Design: Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches by Creswell and Creswell (2018) is a valuable resource with instructions for designing research projects or developing research proposals. It offers guidance in every step of the process, from the literature review to the study design.\nThe Three Cultures: Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and the Humanities in the 21st Century by Kagan (2009) describes the differences of these three academic cultures in their assumptions, vocabulary, and contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustin, Ann E. 2002. “Preparing the Next Generation of Faculty: Graduate School as Socialization to the Academic Career.” The Journal of Higher Education 73 (1): 94–122. https://doi.org/10.1080/00221546.2002.11777132.\n\n\nBerger, Wilhelm. 2010. “Methoden Der Interdisziplinarität.” In Interdisziplinarität.

Rather, they build on ongoing scientific and social debates, they are based on existing knowledge and relate the new findings to previous scientific research and debates. This process of knowledge production usually culminates in the communication of the new findings. This can take various forms, for example in written student papers, scientific papers, books or scientific lectures aimed at a scientific audience. Alternatively, formats are chosen that appeal more to a non-scientific audience, for example blog posts, newspaper articles, presentations at relevant events, etc.",
