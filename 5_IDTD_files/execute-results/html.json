And what are all the other terms?\n\nTo gain a better understanding of this, watch the following video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/KnVWoymu4kI?si=PRAxKZzLcMB4KYlI >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## ID/TD case study\n\nInsight into an inter- and transdisciplinary CDE research project: **How does a region become climate neutral?**\n\nIn 2019, the Oberland-Ost Regional Conference set itself the strategic development goal of moving the region towards climate neutrality. In order to put this goal into practice, a participatory strategy process was initiated with numerous stakeholders from the region. Representatives from the public sector, local clubs and associations, the tourism and mobility sector, energy producers and suppliers, the private sector and the agricultural and forestry sectors have developed a joint \"vision\" and \"transition paths\" (these describe the steps required to realize the vision). In addition, initial \"transition experiments\" were outlined (i.e. pilot projects that reduce regional GHG emissions, such as support for biogas production by local farmers). All of this was published in a \"Transition Agenda\".\n\nThis process was initiated, accompanied and researched by an inter- and transdisciplinary team of CDE researchers from the disciplines of psychology, geography and communication sciences together with representatives of regional authorities. CDE researchers were responsible for identifying and involving key regional stakeholders, as well as facilitating a series of workshops to develop the transition agenda. In addition, a survey was conducted among the local population to find out whether they supported the vision developed by the regional representatives. The results of the survey were then incorporated into the strategy process.\n\n![Visions of a climate neutral region Oberland-Ost (illustration by Samuel Bucheli).](images/Poster_%20Klimaneutrale_Region%20Oberland-Ost.png){#fig-klimaneutral-berneroberland}\n\nThe project was funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy SFOE (Energy Research and Cleantech Section) and co-financed by the Wyss Academy for Nature at the University of Bern and the Economic, Energy and Environmental Directorate of the Canton of Bern.\n\nMore Information on the project on the [CDE-project website](https://www.cde.unibe.ch/forschung/projekte/lokale_energie_transitions_experimente_fuer_eine_klimaneutrale_gesellschaft/index_ger.html).\n\n## Activity\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n### Review terms and definitions\n\nFor each definition choose the correct term.\n\nA specific branch of knowledge or field of study that follows a distinct set of theories, methods, and principles. ```{r}\nmcq(\n  \"A specific branch of knowledge or field of study that follows a distinct set of theories, methods, and principles.\",\n  answer = \"Discipline\",\n  \"Interdisciplinary (ID)\",\n  \"Intra/monodisciplinary\",\n  \"Transdisciplinary (TD)\",\n  \"Multidisciplinary\",\n  \"Crossdisciplinary\"\n)\n```\n\nUses methods and concepts from one field of study to address questions or problems in another.
